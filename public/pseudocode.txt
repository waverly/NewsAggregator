Questions for Tuesday class:

1. How to get jquery keyframe to update dynamically (up and down animation)
2. do i want to save the queries and make a tab for recently searched?
3. is using the "set time out fx" to show the results in top right corner a good or bad choice?
4. on "delete" keypress, make the filtered list reload according to updated query
5. put on loader screen




--------------------------------


1. $.get data from 10 different news sources (make sure to store at least 100 headlines)
- question: how to avoid duplicate headlines in the DB? (every time i refresh they are stored again)
- would it be more useful just to store headlines in an array or JS object so it can be refreshed every time the page reloads?


2. store titles and article descriptions in a firebase databaseURL


3. when user enters query in box: live query, meaning if i just type "T",
titles will show any title including "T"

- When user enters new character into search bar, .headlines is emptied.

- Title animations - could be cascading across screen or the words in sentence could be animated up and down separately on their own

4. the word the user entered will be in red. the background is black. text is white/blue.

5. Displays the total number of titles showing

6. Use javascript to better estimate the lenght of each title by finding .length() of the title and then multiplying
that by the average pixel width of a character. then set the margins for the css animations based on this number.
- question: how to communicate between css animation and javascript


7. how to add FireBase ...
- trending queries (last 10 things ppl have searched for)
- whenever someon clicks headline, save that in headlines - latest headlines viewed

1. SEARCH FUNCTIONALITY
- HOW TO LIVE SEARCH (EACH CHARACTER THAT IS TYPED)
- HOW TO LIVE UPDATE THE ARTICLE COUNT
- on each key down, query firebase

*** filter
- use the filter fx to loop thru  on jquery.change () - to see every time the value changes in search box
- use a reg ex to search each headline and see if it matches input from search bar
- if it does match then return true
- if i use .filter, it will create a new array of only items that return true
- using jquery, empty the current <ul> and append all new array items as <li>
